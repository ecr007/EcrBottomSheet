A sliding Sheet from the bottom of the Screen with 3 States build with SwiftUI.

## Why

There have been many different attempts to recreate the EcrBottomSheet from Apple Maps, Shortcuts and Apple Music, because Apple unfortunately does not provide it in their SDK.

However, all previous attempts share a common problem: The **height does not change** in the different states. Thus, the EcrBottomSheet is always the same size (e.g. 800px) and thus remains 800px, even if you only see e.g. 400px - the rest is **inaccessible** unless you pull the EcrBottomSheet up to the very top.

There are also many implementations out there that **only have 2 states** - **not 3** like e.g. Apple Maps.

### Features
- Dynamic height (works with `ScrollView` and **every** other view)
- Fully customizable States (**any number of states at any height**)
- Many options for **customization** (backgroundBlur, tapToDismiss, swipeToDismiss, etc.)
- Very **easy to use**
- Support for **SearchBar** in the header
- Flick through feature
- Same behavior as Apple for the `.bottom` position
- Beatuiful customizable **animations**

## Requirements 

- iOS 13
- Swift 5.3
- Xcode 12

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The preferred way of installing EcrBottomSheet is via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

>Xcode 11 integrates with libSwiftPM to provide support for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms.

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** → **Swift Packages** → **Add Package Dependency...**
2. Paste the repository URL (`https://github.com/LucasMucGH/EcrBottomSheet`) and click **Next**.
3. For **Rules**, select **Branch** (with branch set to `main`).
4. Click **Finish**.

### CocoaPods

EcrBottomSheet is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'EcrBottomSheetSwiftUI'
```

## Usage

**WARNING:**
This is Sample Code for visualisation where and how to use, without a working initializer. Please see [Examples](#examples) for working code.

EcrBottomSheet is similar to the built-in Sheet:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @State var bottomSheetPosition: EcrBottomSheetPosition = .middle //1
    
    var body: some View {
    
        Map() //2
            .bottomSheet() //3
    }
}
```

`//1` The current State of the EcrBottomSheet.
- This is any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `EcrBottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` (with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`//2` The view which the EcrBottomSheet overlays.

`//3` This is how you add the EcrBottomSheet - easy right?

## Parameters

### Title as Header Content

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    bottomSheetPosition: Binding<EcrBottomSheetPosition>,
    options: [EcrBottomSheet.Options] = [],
    title: String? = nil,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> mContent
)
```

`bottomSheetPosition`: A binding that saves the current state of the EcrBottomSheet.
- This can be any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `EcrBottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` for example (should be used with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`options`: An array that contains the settings / options for the EcrBottomSheet. For more information about the possible options see [Options](#options).

`title`: A string that is used as the title for the EcrBottomSheet.
- Can be `nil`.
- You can use a view that is used as header content for the EcrBottomSheet instead.

`content`: A view that is used as main content for the EcrBottomSheet.

### Custom Header Content

```swift
.bottomSheet(
    bottomSheetPosition: Binding<EcrBottomSheetPosition>,
    options: [EcrBottomSheet.Options] = [],
    @ViewBuilder headerContent: () -> hContent?,
    @ViewBuilder mainContent: () -> mContent
)
```

`bottomSheetPosition`: A binding that saves the current state of the EcrBottomSheet.
- This can be any `enum` that conforms to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`. For more information about custom enums see [Custom States](#custom-states).
- The following states are posible when using the predefinded `EcrBottomSheetPosition`: `.hidden`, `.bottom`, `.middle` and `.top`.
- If you don't want the state to be changed, you can use `.constant(.middle)` for example (should be used with the `.notResizeable` or `.noDragIndicator` option).

`options`: An array that contains the settings / options for the EcrBottomSheet. For more information about the possible options see [Options](#options).

`headerContent`: A view that is used as header content for the EcrBottomSheet.
- Can be `nil`.
- You can use a string that is used as the title for the EcrBottomSheet instead.
- Any view is possible - this can lead to problems if the view is too large. A label, a small picture or text is recommended

`mainContent`: A view that is used as main content for the EcrBottomSheet.

### Options

`.allowContentDrag` Allows the EcrBottomSheet to move when dragging the mainContent.

- Do not use if the mainContent is packed into a ScrollView.

`.animation(Animation)` Sets the animation for opening and closing the EcrBottomSheet.

`.appleScrollBehavior` The mainView is packed into a ScrollView, which can only scrolled at the .top position.

`.background(AnyView)` Changes the background of the EcrBottomSheet.
- Must be erased to AnyView.

`.backgroundBlur(UIBlurEffect.Style = .systemThinMaterial)` Enables and sets the blur effect of the background when pulling up the EcrBottomSheet.

`.cornerRadius(Double)` Changes the corener radius of the EcrBottomSheet.

`.dragIndicatorColor(Color)` Changes the color of the drag indicator.

 `.noBottomPosition` Prevents the lowest value (above 0) from being the bottom position and hiding the mainContent.
 
 `.noDragIndicator` Hides the drag indicator.
 
 `.notResizeable` Hides the drag indicator and prevents the EcrBottomSheet from being dragged.
 
 `.shadow(color: Color = Color(.sRGBLinear, white: 0, opacity: 0.33), radius: CGFloat = 10, x: CGFloat = 0, y: CGFloat = 0)` Adds a shadow to the background of the EcrBottomSheet.
 
 `.showCloseButton(action: () -> Void = {})` Shows a close button and declares an action to be performed when tapped.
 
 - If you tap on it, the EcrBottomSheet and the keyboard always get dismissed.
 
 - If you want to do something extra, you have to declare it here.
 
 `.swipeToDismiss` Dismisses the EcrBottomSheet when swiped down.
 
 `.tapToDissmiss` Dismisses the EcrBottomSheet when the background is tapped.

## Custom States

 
You can create your own custom EcrBottomSheetPosition enum:
   - The enum must be conforming to `CGFloat` and `CaseIterable`
   - The case and enum name doesnt matter
   - The case/state with `rawValue == 0` is hiding the EcrBottomSheet
   - The value can be anythig between `0` and `1` (`x <= 1`, `x >= 0`)
   - The value is the height of the EcrBottomSheet propotional to the screen height (`1 == 100% == full screen`)
   - The lowest value (greater than 0) automaticly gets the `.bottom` behavior. To prevent this please use the option `.noBottomPosition`

```swift
import SwiftUI

enum CustomEcrBottomSheetPosition: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case top = 0.975, topMiddle = 0.7, middle = 0.4, middleBottom = 0.3, bottom = 0.125, hidden = 0
}
```

## Examples

**PLEASE NOTE:** When installed via Cocoapods, please keep in mind that the pod is called `EcrBottomSheetSwiftUI` and not `EcrBottomSheet`; so please use `import EcrBottomSheetSwiftUI` instead.

### Book Detail View

This EcrBottomSheet shows additional information about a book.
You can close it by swiping it away, by tapping on the background or the close button.
It also uses a custom `enum` for the states, since only the states `.middle`, `.bottom` and `.hidden` should exist.

<img src="Assets/BookDetailView.gif" height="600">

```swift
import SwiftUI
import EcrBottomSheet

//The custom EcrBottomSheetPosition enum.
enum BookEcrBottomSheetPosition: CGFloat, CaseIterable {
    case middle = 0.4, bottom = 0.125, hidden = 0

                VStack(spacing: 0) {
                    Text("This tumultuous tale of life in a bleak farmhouse on the Yorkshire moors is a popular set text for GCSE and A-level English study, but away from the demands of the classroom it’s easier to enjoy its drama and intensity.

            .background(LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: self.colors), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing))
    }
}
```

### Word Search View

This EcrBottomSheet shows nouns which can be filtered by searching.
It adopts the scrolling behavior of apple, so that you can only scroll the  `ScrollView ` in the  `.top ` position.
The higher the EcrBottomSheet is dragged, the more blurry the background becomes (with the BlurEffect .dark) to move the focus to the EcrBottomSheet.

<img src="Assets/WordSearchView.gif" height="600">

```swift
import SwiftUI
import EcrBottomSheet

struct WordSearchView: View {
    
    @State private var bottomSheetPosition: EcrBottomSheetPosition = .middle
    
    @State private var searchText: String = ""
    let backgroundColors: [Color] = [Color(red: 0.28, green: 0.28, blue: 0.53), Color(red: 1, green: 0.69, blue: 0.26)]
    let words: [String] = ["birthday", "pancake", "expansion", "brick", "bushes", "coal", "calendar", "home", "pig", "bath", "reading", "cellar", "knot", "year", "ink"]
    
    var body: some View {
        //A green gradient as a background that ignores the safe area.
        LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: self.backgroundColors), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing)
            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            
            .bottomSheet(bottomSheetPosition: self.$bottomSheetPosition, options: [.appleScrollBehavior, .backgroundBlur(effect: .dark)], headerContent: {
                //A SearchBar as headerContent.
                HStack {
                    Image(systemName: "magnifyingglass")
                    TextField("Search", text: self.$searchText)

                .padding(.horizontal, 5)
                .background(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10).fill(Color(UIColor.quaternaryLabel)))
                .padding(.bottom)
                //When you tap the SearchBar, the EcrBottomSheet moves to the .top position to make room for the keyboard.
                .onTapGesture {
                    self.bottomSheetPosition = .top
                }

### Artist Songs View

This EcrBottomSheet shows the most popular songs by an artist.
It has a custom animation and color for the drag indicator and the background, as well as it deactivates the bottom position behavior and uses an custom corner radius and shadow.

<img src="Assets/ArtistSongsView.gif" height="600">

```swift
import SwiftUI
import EcrBottomSheet

struct ArtistSongsView: View {
    
    @State private var bottomSheetPosition: EcrBottomSheetPosition = .middle
    
    let backgroundColors: [Color] = [Color(red: 0.17, green: 0.17, blue: 0.33), Color(red: 0.80, green: 0.38, blue: 0.2)]
    let songs: [String] = ["One Dance (feat. Wizkid & Kyla)", "God's Plan", "SICKO MODE", "In My Feelings", "Work (feat. Drake)", "Nice For What", "Hotline Bling", "Too Good (feat. Rihanna)", "Life Is Good (feat. Drake)"]
    
    var body: some View {
        //A green gradient as a background that ignores the safe area.
        LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: self.backgroundColors), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing)
            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            
            .bottomSheet(bottomSheetPosition: self.$bottomSheetPosition, options: [.animation(.linear.speed(0.4)), .dragIndicatorColor(Color(red: 0.17, green: 0.17, blue: 0.33)), .background(AnyView(Color.black)), .noBottomPosition, .cornerRadius(30), .shadow(color: .white)], title: "Drake") {
                //The list of the most popular songs of the artist.
                ScrollView {
                    ForEach(self.songs, id: \.self) { song in
                        Text(song)
                            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
                            .padding([.leading, .bottom])
                    }
                }
            }
            .foregroundColor(.white)
    }
}
